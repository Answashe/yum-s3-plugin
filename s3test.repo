; baseurl
; If boto is used:
;     -- host name is split on '.'
;     -- first part of host name becomes bucket name used for file retrieval
;     -- everyting in the URL path becomes prefixed to item keys
;
;     So, in the example
;
;
;           baseurl=http://your-bucket-name.s3.amazonaws.com/foo/bar/
;        - Bucket name is 'your-bucket-name'
;        - A retrieval of 'foo.rpm' becomes bucket.get_key( 'foo/bar/foo.rpm' )
;
;     And for
;
;           baseurl=http://your-bucket-name.s3.amazonaws.com/foo.bar.
;
;        - Bucket name is 'your-bucket-name'
;        - A retrieval of 'foo.rpm' becomes bucket.get_key( 'foo.bar.foo.rpm' )
;     
;    And finally
;
;           baseurl=http://your-bucket-name.s3.amazonaws.com/
;
;        - Bucket name is 'your-bucket-name'
;        - A retrieval of 'foo.rpm' becomes bucket.get_key( 'foo.rpm' )
;
;  The Amazon REST API is still untested.   But if it were working, it should work fine using
;  the same URLs for the Boto urlgrabber.
